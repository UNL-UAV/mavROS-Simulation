# mavROS-Simulation

### Information

Repository for getting the simulation up and running. This is using ros and gazebo simulation software.

### Prerequisite

The enviroment you need for the simulation software needs to be ubuntu, any version later than 18.04 should work. The list of things that need to be installed before you can begin using the simulation is in the list below:
1.	ROS
2.	mavROS
3.	geographicLib
4.	px4 firmware
5.	GSTREAMER 1

If you have not used ROS before then I would suggest reading through and doing the tutorials. Once you have a basic understanding you should come back and begin using the simulation. 
A small preview of how this simulation works is in the diagram below:
